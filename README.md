## Bidirectional Conditional Insertion Sort algorithm; An efficient progress on the classical insertion sort [[Published article]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X17301711) 
- New efficient sorting algorithm, which called Bidirectional Conditional Insertion Sort (BCIS), based on insertion sort concept.
- In the algorithm, sorting is done by adding small elements to the left part and big elements to the right part. Because of this idea, it is called Bidirectional.
- Because it is added in two-sided order, there are fewer operations in read / write operation.
- Classical insertion sort, yielded much better results.
- In small size arrays (up to 1500), they achieved a faster result than Quick sort in average case time.
- In sequences with a large number of duplicates, Quick sort has yielded better results.
